This is ^ Ted and you're watching Ted's website. What's a website? Think late
00's but responsive. Also make it use WebP.

It's intended to be, a place where I can express my creativity and share my
thoughts, ideas, practical solutions with you. This website is a personal outlet
for me to connect with others and share my passions. In addition to the blog
posts, I also have a photography section where I can showcase my love for
photography.

I hope you enjoy exploring my blog and thank you for joining me on this journey.

#### About Me

I am a multi-faceted individual with a passion for both entrepreneurship and
technology. Currently, I am the founder of the company behind FoodieApp, a smart
food diary that helps individuals eat better for themselves and the planet. My
responsibilities include overseeing product design and engineering. Before this,
I was the Head of Engineering in Sydney for Snapchat, where I led my team
in delivering exceptional video chat experiences.

Beyond my professional life, I am a proud husband and father to two teenagers.
I enjoy walks, hikes and everything in-between. Add a DSLR to the mix for even
better results.
