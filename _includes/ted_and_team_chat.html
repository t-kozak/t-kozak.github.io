        <div class="human-msg-text">
            <p>That sounds interesting. I can certainly help you with research on using AI for content creation, specifically for blog posts. There are a few different ways that AI can be used to assist with creating blog posts. Some examples include:</p>

            <p>
                - Using natural language generation (NLG) to automatically generate written content from structured data<br/> - Using natural language processing (NLP) to analyze and understand the intent and sentiment of existing content<br/> - Using
                machine learning to generate headlines or summaries for articles<br/> - Using AI-powered writing assistants to help improve grammar, style, and readability<br/></p>

            <p>Please let me know what specific information you are looking for, and I'll do my best to help you find it.</p>

            <p>ok, I'd like you to write for me a draft for a blog post section. The first one will be a simple "intro" section. The talking points are as follows:</p>
            - For the last two years, I've been focusing on creating software.<br/> - I was simply hungry for creation, after N years of managing people at Snap.<br/> - To avoid being yet another failed technical founder who can't think or do marketing,
            I decided to learn it by marketing myself.<br/> - I've started this blog and now want to learn how to do content like a pro in 2023 - AI-powered content creation<br/> now, this should be written as if the author is writing to the audience
            of the world.

        <div class="human-msg-text">
            <p>
                Over the last two years, I've been dedicating my time and energy to creating software. It's been a passion of mine for a long time, and I was eager to jump into it full-force after spending many years managing people at Snap.
            </p>
            <p>As a technical founder, I know that it can be easy to get caught up in the technical aspects of building a product and neglect the importance of marketing and creating engaging content. That's why I decided to take matters into my own hands
                and learn how to do marketing by marketing myself. I started this blog as a way to share my journey and to document my progress as I learn how to become a pro at content creation in 2023.
            </p>
            <p>One area I'm particularly interested in is using AI-powered tools to assist with content creation. I believe that these tools can be incredibly powerful and can help us to create high-quality, engaging content more efficiently and effectively.
                I'm excited to explore this topic further and to share my findings with you all as I continue to learn and grow as a content creator.

            <p>Sure! Here's a less formal, more playful take on the same information:</p>

            <p>For the past two years, I've been living my best life as a software creator. I was just itching to build something after spending so many years managing people at Snap. But as a technical founder, I knew I had to up my content game if I wanted
                to avoid becoming another failed tech founder who can't market their way out of a paper bag. So, I decided to learn how to market myself, and what better way to do that than starting a blog?</p>

            <p>So here I am, ready to take on the world of content creation like a pro in 2023. And you know what's gonna make that happen? AI-powered content creation, baby! I'm excited to dive deeper into this topic and share my findings with all of you.
                Who knows, maybe I'll even make the AI write this blog for me and I can finally take a break.</p>

            <p>Let's make it happen together!</p>

            <p>Sure thing! Here's a section that lists the outcomes of this blog post:</p>

            <p>So, what are we aiming to achieve with this blog post? Well, first and foremost, we want to create a meta blog post that dives into the world of using publicly available state-of-the-art AI tools to create blog posts. By the end of this post,
                you'll have a solid understanding of the different tools available and how to use them effectively.</p>

            <p>But wait, there's more! We're also going to create a podcast that'll be like a voice-over of this blog post. Because, let's be real, sometimes reading ain't for everyone. So, for those of you who are more auditory learners, this podcast will
                be perfect for you.</p>

            <p>Lastly, we want to create a process for efficient content creation using these AI tools for subsequent blog posts. We'll be sharing tips and tricks on how to streamline your content creation workflow so you can focus on what matters most -
                creating awesome content.</p>

            <p>I'm ready to work on next section. The section title is "Ethical consideration" and I need it to be more serious than funny. Talking points:</p>
            <p>
                - People all around are shouting about how evil AI overlords are upon us<br/> - I find it excessive, but I do believe some consideration is needed<br/> - ChatGPT can be used to churn out mountains of low-quality content that is somewhat
                ethically shady, but it's not my style so not a problem for me<br/> - I can't see how the way I use it to come up with form rather than substance can ever infringe on someones' copyright, like it can with the image diffusion<br/> - That
                being said, It's still early I'll be on the lookout<br/>
            </p>

    <div class="bot-msg">
        <div class="bot-avatar">
            <div class="bot-svg-wrap"><img src="/assets/bot.svg" /></div>
        </div>
        <div class="human-msg-text">
            <p>Certainly. Here's a section that addresses the ethical considerations of using AI to assist with content creation:</p>

            <p>As AI continues to advance and become more integrated into our daily lives, there are many who raise concerns about its potential impact on society. People all around are shouting about how evil AI overlords are upon us. While I find this
                level of alarm to be excessive, I do believe that some consideration is needed when it comes to using AI for content creation.</p>

            <p>One potential issue with using AI tools like ChatGPT is that it could be used to churn out mountains of low-quality content that is somewhat ethically shady. However, this is not a problem for me, as I believe in using AI tools to enhance
                and augment my own creativity, rather than to replace it.</p>

            <p>I also believe that the way I use ChatGPT to come up with ideas and structure, rather than substance, is unlikely to infringe on someone's copyright. However, when it comes to image diffusion, things are different and I will be on the lookout.
            </p>

            <p>That being said, it's still early days for AI and its impact on content creation. As the technology continues to evolve and advance, it's important that we continue to consider the ethical implications of its use and make sure that we use
                it in a responsible and ethical manner.</p>

            <p>ok my friend, we're reaching the final section - conclusions. See talking points to cover below:</p>
            <p>- Before working on this piece, my perception of ChatGTP came from people poking the system to see its capabilities.<br/> - I was more interested in seeing how it can be utilised in one's workflow.<br/> - The system met all my expectations.
                Then delivered more as I found it pleasant to interact with<br/> - Regarding the whole podcasting experience with ElevenLabs Speech Synthesis, I found the quality of audio simply stunning<br/> - Yet I don't believe it's enough to go beyond
                a simple voiceover, audiobook and use it as a tool to create podcasts of quality matching other content available on the market<br/> - I had fun and am looking to work more with these systems<br/> - Until next time, thanks, ted<br/>
            </p>

        <div class="human-msg-text">
            Certainly. Here's the final section that concludes the blog post:</p>
            <p>Before beginning this project, my perception of ChatGPT was shaped by others poking the system to see what it could do. However, I was more interested in exploring how it could be used in a workflow for content creation.</p>
            <p>I am pleased to say that the system met all of my expectations and even exceeded them. I found the experience of working with ChatGPT to be enjoyable and was impressed by the quality of the content it was able to generate.</p>
            <p>The experience of using ElevenLabs Speech Synthesis to create a podcast was also stunning. The quality of the audio was simply amazing. However, I don't believe that it's enough to go beyond using it as a simple voiceover for an audiobook.
                To create podcasts that match the quality of other content available on the market, more work is needed.</p>

            <p>Overall, I had a great time working on this project and I am looking forward to continuing to work with these AI systems in the future. Until next time, thanks for reading!</p>

            <p>Best regards,</p>
