I've been living my best life as a software person for the past two years. After years of managing people at Snap, I was itching to build something again. I knew that just writing software won't be enough. I had to up my content game to avoid becoming another failed tech founder who can't market their way out of a paper bag. I decided to learn to sell myself, and what better way to do that than by starting a blog?

So here I am, ready to take on the world of content creation like a pro in 2023. And you know what's gonna make that happen? AI-powered content creation, baby! I'm excited to dive deeper into this topic and share my findings with all of you. Who knows, I'll even make the AI write this blog for me, and I can finally take a break.

You can listen to the voice over of this story below.

### Goals
What are we aiming to achieve with this blog post? First and foremost, we want to create a meta blog post that dives into the world of using publicly available state-of-the-art AI tools to create blog posts. By the end of this post, you'll have a solid understanding of the different tools available and how to use them effectively.

But wait, there's more! We'll also create a podcast with a voiceover of this blog post. Because, let's be honest, sometimes reading ain't for everyone. So, for those of you who are more auditory learners, this podcast will be perfect for you.



### The Actors
When it comes to creating high-quality content, it's all about having the right tools at your disposal. That's why, for this blog post, we'll introduce a few different AI platforms to help us create the best possible content.

First up, we have Ted K. He's the human responsible for talking points, orchestration, audio editing, and publishing. He's the man with the plan, and we couldn't do it without him.

Next, we have ChatGPT. This is an AI-powered copywriting tool that we'll be using to help us write high-quality, engaging content. It's a fantastic resource, and we're excited to see what kind of magic it can work on this post.

We'll also be using Grammarly for text editing. This AI-powered writing assistant will help us to catch any grammar mistakes, typos, and awkward phrases, so you'll get the best quality content. Battle of AIs!

We will use Elevenlabs text-to-speech synthesizer for the podcast to ensure our voiceover sounds as natural as possible. Finally, we'll use the Apple "say" command for text-to-speech for ChatGPT's voiceover. It's a simple and easy way to get the job done.

With these tools at our disposal, we're confident that we'll be able to create high-quality, engaging content that you'll love. So stay tuned and get ready to learn all about AI-powered content creation!

### The Process
Before we can start churning out content, ensure you have created accounts on all the services we'll need, specifically: [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [ElevenLabs](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/), [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) and finally, [PodBean](https://www.podbean.com/), the podcast hosting platform. All these services are free for testing but probably work best with some subscription tiers. I trust you to figure out the best details for you.

Creating the content itself is pretty straightforward. You develop a subject and scaffolding (sections) of the story to be told. AI first shines by filling the scaffold. ChatGPT can create a complete chapter with you controlling mood, style, and so on, with just a few talking points. You may have to ask it to "write" something in a different manner. Overall it's a pleasant experience to "chat" with a team member working for you. With a slight difference and returned within seconds rather than hours/days.

I would only ask it to generate part of the piece in one go, but working on a section-by-section basis worked well. The downside of this approach is that ChatGPT tends to add a summary paragraph at the end of each section, just as if it was the whole piece. It might be the style I asked for, so YMMV.

With the content ready, whether generated by AI or written manually, I always love to process it through Grammarly. The tool makes me more confident since English is my 2nd tongue. Still, with the AI-generated content, the confidence given by Grammarly is worth it.

Finally, turning the post into an audible "podcast" using ElevenLabs is as simple as finding the voice you like, throwing the text into the input, and asking the system to "Generate". You may have to tweak the text for better results. Add ellipses for a more dramatic pause, and restructure some bullet points. Plus, add a description for any images or graphic elements, but this is a clear win from the accessibility perspective too!

With the content ready, all that's left is to press the submit button. For blogging, it's obvious. For the "podcast", I've been using PodBean, simply because it was one of the top results for a DuckDuckGo Search query "podcast how to?". I have yet to publish it via Spotify or other apps as it's too much of an Etsy quality for me.

### Ethical considerations.
As AI advances and becomes more integrated into our daily lives, many raise concerns about its potential impact on society. People all around are shouting about how evil AI overlords are upon us. While I find this alarming level excessive, some consideration is needed when using AI for content creation.

One potential issue with using AI tools like ChatGPT is that it could be used to churn out mountains of low-quality content. However, this does not apply to my case, as I am using AI tools to enhance and augment my creativity rather than replace it. To clarify where Ted ends and AI starts, I plan to include a transcript of my conversation with the AI at the end of each post.

My way of using ChatGPT to come up with a form rather than substance is unlikely to infringe on someone's copyright. However, things are different regarding image diffusion, and I am more conscious of using these.

The accuracy of facts provided by the platform is another potential risk factor when using AI. Still, since I gave it all the points I want to write about - again, it's not applicable here.

That being said, it's still the early days for AI and its impact on content creation. As technology continues to evolve and advance, we must continue to consider the ethical implications of its use and make sure that we use it responsibly and ethically.

### Conclusions
Before beginning this project, my perception of ChatGPT was shaped by others poking the system to see what it could do. However, I was more interested in exploring how it could be used in a workflow for content creation.

I am pleased that the system met all my expectations and exceeded them. I found the experience of working with ChatGPT enjoyable and was impressed by the quality of the content it was able to generate.

The experience of using ElevenLabs Speech Synthesis to create a podcast was also stunning. The quality of the audio was simply superb. However, more is needed to go beyond using it as a simple voiceover for audiobooks. More work is required to create podcasts that match the quality of other content available on the market, and it's work I'm not willing to commit to right now.

Overall, I had a great time working on this project, and I look forward to continuing to work with these AI systems in the future. Until next time, thanks for reading!

<p>Best regards,<br/>
Ted.</p>
