```python
print('Hello World!')
```

â€¦is the quintessential first one-liner for anyone dipping their toes into
programming in any language. Since this is Hey World, it feels like a good way
to introduce myself to the platform.

A friend of mine spent a lot of time recently trying to convince me that I do
have something to say to the World, something the World may find valuable. Well,
it seems, I got convinced. Thank you T!

In any way, you can expect to find some words of mine related to the things I
care about and have some experience with. Things like Software Engineering
practice on almost all levels of abstraction, startups, parenting in the
digital age and more.

Well, World, I'm looking forward to interacting more!config
